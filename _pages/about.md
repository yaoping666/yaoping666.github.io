About me 
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Research Experience
======
* Comparative research on liquidity Index based on asset pricing model ， Graduation thesis，	June. 2023
  * Liquidity factors were constructed from three indexes, High-low spread, turnover rate and Amihud illiquidity index, and were introduced into CAPM model and Fama-French three-factor model.
  * Empirical tests showed that there is not only a significant liquidity premium in China's A-share stock market, but also that stock liquidity plays an important role in the asset pricing process.
  * Studied the applicability of liquidity index and asset pricing model for other small and medium-sized stock markets in China, and found that the liquidity premium phenomenon in these markets is not obvious.
* Decomposing and valuing exchangeable bonds: a new design based on multi stocks ， working paper， Dec. 2023
  * Supervised by Prof. Jianfen Feng.
  * Based on the situation that large shareholders hold multiple stocks, this paper designs a research framework of the exchangeable bond based on multi stocks and creatively designs the redemption trigger scale adjustment factor.
  * Provided numerical example, studied the valuation for exchangeable bonds and sensitivity analysis of parameters by combining the least squares Monte Carlo simulation method and the public random number method.
  * Compared with single-asset exchangeable bonds, exchangeable bonds based on multi-assets increases the option of the conversion resulting in the higher value of the bonds. The sensitivity analysis shows that the redemption clause has a similar effect, while the selling back clause has little effect on the exchangeable bonds based on two assets.
* Clustering strategies based on stock price patterns ， Course paper，	Jan. 2024
  * Worked as a team leader on group assignments, responsible for topic selection, data collection, programming.
  * Extracted key price points of the stock chart to quantify the stock price patterns, and the K-clustering and support vector machine algorithms were used to predict and select stocks. Calculated two-year holding returns.
  * Calculated the difference between each closing price chart and the two adjacent closing prices. The first few key points which were the most different from the 
    adjacent points were used as the standard of classification.
  * Chose the tan value of the Angle between the lines of the two key price points to represent the rise and fall.
  * The overall performance of the strategy is better, with higher annualized return, smaller volatility and maximum retracement, larger sharpe ratio and net worth, and significantly better than CSI300 in various indicators.
* The impact of climate policy uncertainty on energy market and CER market ， Graduation thesis， May. 2024
    * Research on how the impact of climate policy uncertainty affects the thermal coal futures market, crude oil futures market and carbon emission permit market, and the difference of this impact under different market conditions.
  * Used QVAR model to analyze the impulse responses under different quantile conditions, and measure the response of different markets to the shock of Chinese climate policy uncertainty.
  * Calculated directional, net and total spillover indexes to analyze the static spillover effects between climate policy uncertainty and energy market returns. 
    The rolling window is set as 36 months to observe the time series characteristics of the dynamic spillover effect between climate policy uncertainty and market returns.
* The impact of blockchain environmental monitoring on urban pollution ， Research project，	Jun. 2024
    * As a research assistant, was responsible for data collection, empirical research and writing the intro of the paper.
  * Downloaded air quality data from the websites of prefecture-level and county-level municipal governments and extracted pollutants and economic indicators from 
    statistical yearbooks, and used R for seasonal adjustment.
  * Used propensity score matching to find control groups with similar characteristics to the treatment group which are Cities that have used blockchain technology in environmental monitoring.
  * Defined the industry classification of air pollution, high emissions, high nitrogen and phosphorus emissions according to various types of pollution and 
    environment related documents issued by the government.
* Forecasting Market Returns: The Role of Industries in China ， Working paper，	Sep. 2024
    * Investigated whether the returns of industry portfolios predict stock market movements. In Chinense stock market, a significant number of industry returns forecast the stock market by up to two months.
  * Examined the ability of these industries to predict the market in comparison to well-known predictors such as inflation, default spread, and dividend yield and find comparable forecasting power.
  * Examined the ability of these industries to predict the economic activity and observing the relation between the two sets of coefficients which indicates that an industry's predictive ability is strongly correlated with its propensity to forecast indicators of economic activity.
